# Getting Started with R1 App Development

Welcome to the Rabbit R1 Creations SDK! This guide will help you build your first app for the R1 device in just a few minutes.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Set Up Your Development Environment

```bash
# Clone the SDK repository
git clone https://github.com/nytemode/r1-creations-sdk.git
cd r1-creations-sdk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

Your documentation site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### 2. Create Your First App

```bash
# Copy a template
cp -r apps/templates/simple-app apps/my-apps/my-first-app
cd apps/my-apps/my-first-app

# Edit your app
# - index.html: Structure
# - css/styles.css: Styling
# - js/app.js: Logic
```

### 3. Test Your App

```bash
# Open in browser for testing
python -m http.server 8000
# Visit http://localhost:8000

# Use keyboard fallbacks:
# Spacebar = PTT button
# Arrow keys = Scroll wheel
```

### 4. Generate QR Code for R1

```bash
# Generate QR code for R1 installation
node utils/generate-r1-qr.js "my-first-app" png

# This creates my-first-app-r1-qr.png
```

### 5. Deploy to Vercel

```bash
# Build all apps
npm run build

# Deploy
npx vercel --prod
```

## üì± R1 Device Basics

### Screen Specifications
- **Resolution**: 240 √ó 282 pixels
- **Aspect Ratio**: ~0.85:1
- **Display**: LCD with good contrast

### Input Methods
- **PTT Button**: Primary interaction (sideClick event)
- **Scroll Wheel**: Up/down navigation (scrollUp/scrollDown events)
- **Long Press**: Extended button press (longPressStart/longPressEnd)

### Development Considerations
- Use viewport units (vw/vh) for responsive design
- Minimum touch targets: 44px
- Optimize for small screen real estate
- Test with keyboard fallbacks during development

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

1. **Develop**: Use browser dev tools with keyboard simulation
2. **Test**: Deploy to Vercel for device testing
3. **Generate QR**: Create installation codes
4. **Install**: Scan QR with R1 device
5. **Iterate**: Make improvements based on device testing
